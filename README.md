## Motivation
This was a project taken on in our spare time in an attempt to create a "google maps for Laurier" by mapping every entrance/exit to every building on campus. 

## How it works
Connor and I actually walked around the whole campus getting the exact latitude and longitude of each entrance/exit. We then plugged them into our program and with some help from the Mapbox API and Dijkstras algorithm we take the users' current location and display the shortest path between the user and their desired location.
